# **Word Processor**

This is a basic online word processor, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The icons are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons/).

It uses the JavaScript `execCommand()` function.

It is licensed under the Apache license 2.0.

## __Building It__

On your computer, download and install Git from [https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download), and then open the Terminal app on macOS, Linux, or Chrome OS, or Git Bash, WSL, or cmd.exe (Command Prompt/CMD) on Windows, and then enter these commands without the dollar sign or space, pressing Enter/Return after each command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Zachary-Rude/Word-Processor.git
$ cd Word-Processor
```

Or, you could not use the `cd` command, and instead open the file manager on your computer (File Explorer/Windows Explorer on Windows, Finder on Macintosh, and Files on most other operating systems), and then right-click (press the Ctrl key and left-click on Mac) on the `Word-Processor` folder, and then open the `index.html` file in your browser. I recommend using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

With this method of using it, you can use it offline.
